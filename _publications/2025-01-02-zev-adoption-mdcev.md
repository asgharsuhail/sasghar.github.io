This study conducts an in-depth analysis of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) adoption and usage using data from the 2019 California Vehicle Survey and Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) modeling. The study examines how socioeconomic characteristics, household composition, vehicle types, attitudes toward emerging transportation technologies, and spatial factors influence the adoption and operational patterns of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles.
