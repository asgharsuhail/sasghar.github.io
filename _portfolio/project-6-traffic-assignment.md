**Period:** 2020 – 2021

Conducted a comparative analysis of traffic assignment methods to evaluate the efficiency and convergence rates of different algorithms used in transportation modeling. The study examined traditional and newly developed algorithms, including the Frank-Wolfe method, Bi-Conjugate Frank-Wolfe (Bi-CFW), and a modified path-based greedy algorithm.

**Role:** Lead — Literature review, traffic assignment, programming. Support — Technical communication.
